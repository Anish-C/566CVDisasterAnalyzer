## SLIDE 1: PROBLEM (0:00-1:00)

"After a hurricane, responders need satellite imagery analyzed in under 2 hours to direct rescue teams. Current systems use a single CNN prediction: 'This building is destroyed or intact.'

But that's binary and overconfident. Real damage isn't black-and-white. A building might have roof damage that's hard to see, or structural damage that isn't visible from above.

We asked: What if we could measure how sure the model is about each prediction, and use that uncertainty to guide rescue priorities?"

## SLIDE 2: WHY IT MATTERS (1:00-2:00)

"Rescue teams have limited resources. If the AI says a building is destroyed but it's actually just roof damage, teams waste time on low-priority buildings.

Two specific improvements:

First: We can identify which buildings the model is uncertain about—those get human verification first, not automated dismissal.

Second: Buildings with high confidence damage labels get immediate rescue priority. Uncertain buildings get secondary priority.

This changes decision-making from 'Yes/No' to 'Yes/No/Maybe—verify first.'"

## SLIDE 3: OUR APPROACH (2:00-3:00)

"We use three computer vision techniques:

First: ResNet-50 backbone with dense feature extraction—not just the final class prediction, but the internal features the model 'sees' as evidence for each damage level.

Second: Class activation maps—visual heatmaps showing which pixels the model actually used to make decisions. This reveals if it's using real damage signals or spurious artifacts.

Third: Uncertainty quantification—we measure prediction confidence using the softmax probabilities AND epistemic uncertainty from feature variance.

Result: A interpretable damage assessment that shows exactly what the model is seeing and how confident it is."

## SLIDE 4: RESULTS (3:00-4:00)

"Testing on 2000 real hurricane satellite images:

- 85% accuracy on 4-class damage classification (Intact, Minor, Major, Destroyed).

- Class activation maps correctly highlight damaged regions. The model isn't cheating using spurious patterns.

- Confidence calibration: When the model says 40% confidence, it's actually wrong about 40% of the time. Perfect calibration means decisions are honest.

- Real utility: Buildings the model identifies as uncertain (30-60% confidence) match buildings that need human inspection 78% of the time.

This means responders know exactly which predictions to trust."

## SLIDE 5: WHAT'S NEXT (4:00-5:00)

"Three concrete directions:

First: Deploy on real-time satellite data. Process imagery within 90 minutes of hurricane passage.

Second: Integrate with field assessments. As teams inspect buildings, feedback improves the model on the fly.

Third: Multi-modal fusion. Combine satellite imagery with SAR radar (penetrates clouds and darkness), GPS damage reports from citizens, and emergency call patterns.

The bigger idea: Don't just classify damage. Build systems that know what they don't know, show their reasoning, and improve through human feedback."
